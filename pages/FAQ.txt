What is typeset?
Typeset is the page where you can connect to the printer, and type paragraphs to print.

Does it work on mobile?
The printing can only be done on modern desktop Chrome and Chrome for Android. iPhone support is impsobile due to Apple's hardware restrictions.

Design choices?
Originally the site had a more typewriter feel, but I dropped with in excanche for a more modern font and layout. I think this makes it easier on the eyes, if less thematic. The accent color (yellow #fffb07) is spread throughout the site and resembles a highlight color. It helps give the pages life, instead of everything being grayscale.

How does it work?
The simple version is that it uses a library to connect through your computer or phone to the Arduino device which takes the input and converts it into data that the thermal printer can use. For a more in depth explanation, see the code tab.

What coding languages are used in this project?
This website is coded, like most websites, using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The printer code is written in Arduino C.

Why no JQuery?
In an effort to keep this website as fast and pure as possible, I have limited the number of external libraries to just WebUSB, as there's no way around using that. JQuery is just an easier was to do things you can do with a little more time in regular JavaScript. For me, learning pure JS is more useful as it will likely be around for longer than JQuery.

How much of this did you write yourself?
Aside from the WebUSB code (serial.js and part of console.js) it is all written by me. I used the MDN Docs and w3schools for references on CSS, HTML, and JS code. There were also numerous fourm threads that aided me with specific problems I ran into when developing txtprint.
